# Lab 1: Artemis

## Introduction

In this lab, I gained familiarity with the Artemis Nano board by running four demo programs on it using the Arduino IDE.

## Materials

- 1 x SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano
- 1 x USB C-to-C cable

## Implementation

### Blink it Up

For this program, I used the Blink example code that came with the Arduino IDE. This program allowed me to blink the onboard LED. I slowed the baud rate down to 9600 to be able to see the blinking better.


### Serial

For this program, I used the Example04_Serial example code that came with the Artemis Nano installation. This program printed out text to the serial monitor and also "echoed" any text I provided as input, by printing it to the serial monitor. I had to adjust the serial monitor's baud rate to 115200, matching the rate defined in the code, in order to be able to view the output.


### Analog Read

For this program, I used the Example02_AnalogRead example code that came with the Artemis Nano installation. 


### Microphone Output

For this program, I used the Example1_MicrophoneOutput example code that came with the Artemis Nano installation.


## Conclusion

By running various demo programs on the Artemis Nano board, I was able to become comfortable with programming it and utilizing its onboard components.
