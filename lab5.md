# Lab 5: Motors and Open Loop Control

## Prelab

I connected the motor drivers, Artemis, and battery as detailed in the diagram below.

The motors and the Artemis are powered by separate batteries, with the motors' battery having a higher capacity (850mAh) than the Artemis' battery (650mAh), because the motors require more power than the Artemis does.
