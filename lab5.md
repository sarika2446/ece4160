# Lab 5: Motors and Open Loop Control

## Prelab

I connected the motor drivers, Artemis, and battery as detailed in the diagram below.

The motors and the Artemis are powered by separate batteries, with the motors' battery having a higher capacity (850mAh) than the Artemis' battery (650mAh), because the motors require more power than the Artemis does.

## Lab Tasks

I connected the power supply and oscilloscope to one motor driver, as seen below.

I then ran the following code on the Artemis send the motor driver PWM signals.

The oscilloscope waveform confirmed that I could regulate the power on the motor driver output.

I repeated this process for the second motor driver and got the same results.
