# Lab 8: Stunts

## Task A: Position Control

For this lab, I had to use a robot from a previous year since my motor driver stopped working. 

The robot started at the designated line, which was <4m from the wall, and drove towards the center of the sticky mat. The setup is shown in the picture below.

I used the following code to make my robot do a flip at 0.5m from the wall.

Below are videos of three trials in which my robot was able to successfully perform a flip.
