# Lab 8: Stunts

## Task A: Position Control

For this lab, I chose to do the position control task. 

The robot started at the designated line, which was <4m from the wall, and drove towards the center of the sticky mat. The setup is shown in the picture below.

I used the following code to time my robot do a flip at 0.5m from the wall. The robot drove at full speed forward for a set number of seconds, and then immediately started driving backward at full speed for a set number of seconds.

Below are videos of three trials in which my robot was able to successfully perform a flip.
