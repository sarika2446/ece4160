# Lab 8: Stunts

## Task A: Position Control

For this lab, I had to use a robot from a previous year since my motor driver stopped working. 

My robot started at the designated line, which was <4m from the wall, and drove towards the center of the sticky mat. The setup is shown in the picture below.

I was able to make the robot do a flip at 0.5m from the wall using the following code.
